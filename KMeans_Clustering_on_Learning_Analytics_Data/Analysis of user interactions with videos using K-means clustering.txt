To analyze user interactions with videos using K-means clustering, we follow these steps:

Data Collection: Gather data on user interactions, including:
    User ID
    Video ID
    Start time of video playback
    Duration watched
    Time spent on specific segments (if available)

Feature Engineering: Transform the data into a format suitable for K-means. Possible features include:
    Total watch time per video
    Number of times a video was played
    Specific segments watched (e.g., 0-10 seconds, 10-30 seconds, etc.)
    Time of day when the video was played

Data Preprocessing:
    Normalize the data to ensure features contribute equally to distance calculations.
    Handle any missing values or outliers.

K-means Clustering:
    Choose a value for k (the number of clusters). This can be done using methods like the elbow method or silhouette score.
    Apply the K-means algorithm to cluster users based on their viewing patterns.

Analysis of Clusters:
    Examine the clusters to identify patterns, such as:
        Users who prefer certain video types or timeframes.
        Viewing habits, like binge-watching or short, frequent views.

Visualization:
    Use visual tools (like scatter plots or heatmaps) to represent clusters and understand user segments better.

Actionable Insights:
    Based on the clustering results, tailor content recommendations, improve user engagement, or optimize video release strategies.
